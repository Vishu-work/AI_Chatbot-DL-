## 🧠 Why This is a Deep Learning Project

This project leverages **Cohere's `command-nightly` model**, a transformer-based large language model (LLM). These models are built using **deep learning architectures (transformers)** trained on massive datasets to perform natural language understanding and generation.

### 💡 Deep Learning Elements:
- ✅ Uses **pre-trained transformer models** (similar to GPT, BERT)
- ✅ Inference done via **LLMs trained on unsupervised data**
- ✅ Represents **real-world deep learning application** via deployed model APIs
- ✅ Structure ready for **text and vision model integration**
